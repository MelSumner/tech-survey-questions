# tech-survey-questions
A repo for tech survey questions because the state of tech surveys is that they ask questions poorly and the demographics of respondents show it.

Anyone can submit a PR to add a question to this repo.


## General survey guidance

1. Don't ask about "favorites".
2. If you do ask about favorites, then the answer format should be an empty input field. Anything else demonstrates your own personal biases.
